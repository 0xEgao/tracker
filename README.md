# Tracker

A lightweight tracker.

## What it does

- Indexes the blockchain for **fidelity transactions** (i.e., ones using timelocked contracts).
- Tracks and maintains an ordered list of **onion addresses** based on a ranking system (TBD).
- Lets **takers** connect to the tracker and fetch a list of known **maker addresses**.

## Status

Still early days â€” the ranking system for ordering addresses is not finalized yet.

## Goal

Make it easy for anyone to discover and interact with active makers on the network.
